# IMCI Chatbot

Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is a strategy formulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), presented in 1996 as the principal strategy to improve child health. More details to be added later.

## Implementation

A chatbot is implemented using [Sarufi](https://sarufi.io) by leveraging a combination of both intent and LLM method. In this documentation we'll cover the LLM part at large.
It requires a means of performing searches via a web. This is achieved by having LLM(Large Language Model) utilise agent's tool.The agent's tools are used by the model to expand the knowledge base and improve the performance of the model. As per project requirements, the LLM was to decide when to use the agent's tools and when to use the LLM's own knowledge.

Tools come in place to help search for research papers and handle over the details to LLM to put in a human redable way. The response is to include the link to the research paper and the summary of the paper. The summary is to be generated by the LLM after receiving search results from the agent's tools. The search was to be made only on google scholar. The language model uses the agent with collection of tools to perform ttasks using particular tool as per description of the task. The agent's tools are used to perform the task and the results are passed to the LLM to generate the response.

LLM should use agent's tool to search for research papers on google scholar and use the results to generate the response. The response should include the link to the research paper and the summary of the paper. The summary is to be generated by the LLM after receiving search results from the agent's tools. The search was to be made only on google scholar. This is to indicate that the LLM did not use its own knowledge to answer the question.

Below is the flow of a chatbot implemented using LLMs.
